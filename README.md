# Calculator
The goal of this project was to practice vanilla JavaScript fundamentals. While creating this calculator, I reinforced concepts like constructor functions, “this” value, switch operators, and event listeners. A portion of this project was influenced by a tutorial but I added my own styling, background, and modified button shapes.
